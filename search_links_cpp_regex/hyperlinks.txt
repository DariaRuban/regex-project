The attribute href (short for hyper reference) defines the link target. A website’s URI is expected as the attribute’s worth. Example: href="http://www.example.org". 
The URL http://www.example.xx.org is defined as the target address of the hyperlink.
Internal and external links are used primarily by human users to navigate websites. An additional benefit of hyperlinks in the context of search engine optimization (in short: SEO) (https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/online-marketing/search-engine-marketing/the-basics-of-search-engine-optimization/) only emerged with the creation of Google bots, especially search engine crawlers that also use hyperlinks to develop websites and evaluate connections to other websites. For a long time, hyperlinks were the main criteria for a website’s rating, a fact that made them decisive for search engine rankings.
Today, the importance of the hyperlink has become relativized. Modern search engine algorithms use a multitude of ranking factors (https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/online-marketing/search-engine-marketing/the-most-important-google-ranking-factors/) to present internet users with the most relevant results for each search query. Nevertheless, the internal linking and backlink profile are still very important for search engine optimization.
